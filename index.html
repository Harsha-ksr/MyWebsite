            </h5>

            <p class="about">
                Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New
                Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and
                won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is
                generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. Einstein became deeply
                religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and chanting religious songs on the
                way to school. This began to change, however, after he read science books that contradicted his
                religious beliefs. This challenge to established authority left a deep and lasting impression.

                            Quantum Theory of Light. Einstein’s quantum theory of light proposed that light is composed
                            of small packets of energy called photons that have wave-like properties.
                            E=mc2. He demonstrated the link between mass and energy that led to the nuclear energy
                            today.
                            Brownian Movement. This could by far be the best Albert Einstein discoveries, where his
                            observation of the zigzag movement particles in suspension, helped to prove the existence of
                            atoms.
                            General Theory of Relativity. Einstein proposed that gravity is a curved field in the
                            space-time continuum created by the existence of mass.

                            I accept this opportunity of communication with English astronomers and physicists. It was
                            in accordance with the high and proud tradition of English science that English scientific
                            men should have given their time and labour and that English institutions should have
                            provided the material means, to test a theory that had been completed and published in the
                            country of their enemies in the midst of war.

                        Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
                        There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
                        I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
                        I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.
                        Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.
